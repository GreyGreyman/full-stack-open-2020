This repository contains my exercise solutions for [Full Stack Open 2020](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course by The University of Helsinki.

## About:
This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.The course also contains a section on GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.

The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data.

This year's edition of the course contains a new part on TypeScript. Content for this part is provided by Terveystalo
